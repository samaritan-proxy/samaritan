**Samaritan (səˈmerətn)** is a client side L4 or L7 proxy, written in Golang, with the aim to provide high availability and load balancing. You can call it Sam (sam) for simplicity.

_We named this project Samaritan as it saves our OPs from extreme misery:_

> A charitable or helpful person (with reference to Luke 10:33).

> "suddenly, miraculously, a Good Samaritan leaned over and handed the cashier a dollar bill on my behalf"
